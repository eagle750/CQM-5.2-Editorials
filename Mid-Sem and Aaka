Question No-4-https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/cqm-5-2/challenges/mid-sem-and-prashant-jee

There are 2 cases here:

1.if p = q — then the range consists of a single number, hence the answer will be p.
2.else if p < q — we have gcd(p, p + 1, p + 2, ..., q) = gcd(gcd(p, p + 1), p + 2, ..., q) = gcd(1, p + 2, ..., q) = 1.
